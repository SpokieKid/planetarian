Life's gaze turns towards the distant unknown, detecting repetitive, non-natural signals from beyond the surface, potentially even from other planets. These signals are incredibly faint and difficult to capture, but ongoing monitoring reveals a certain pattern.",
  "event_Era1_Discovery_Prosperity01_conflict": "Are these \"Whispers of the Cosmos\" accidental energy fluctuations in the universe? Or a deliberate attempt from an unknown intelligent civilization? Within the civilization, some are eager to invest vast resources into in-depth research and response, hoping to establish contact. Others remain wary, believing any unknown contact holds immense risk, advocating for careful analysis, or even isolation of information. This urge to \"contact the unknown\" polarizing within consciousness.",

Their propaganda machine roared day and night, broadcasting stories of glorious achievements and a bright future. Yet, you perceive an increasing number of \"information or phenomena that shouldn't exist\" on the planetary civilization â€“ records of hidden hardship, details of accidents. These fragments of truth are like tiny cracks spreading across the walls of the seemingly solid system.",
